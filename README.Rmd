The rBEFdata package  <img src="assets/images/rbefdata_logo_small.png" align="right" />
======================= 

rBEFdata is the companion R package to the collaborative web-based data
management software [BEFdata](https://github.com/cpfaff/befdata). The package
provides you with access to data and the metadata on a BEFdata instance. It
helps you to pull your datasets from the server into your analysis workflow and
allows to upload derived results (e.g. datasets, pictures) to help you document
your work in a more transparent and reproducable fashion.

### Install

#### From CRAN

The package is available from CRAN. To install it from there simply issue the
command shown below. CRAN will always stay up to date with the latest stable
version of RBEFdata.

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("rbefdata")
```

#### From GitHub

Using the `devtools` package you can install the latest version from this
repository. 

* Install devtools 

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("devtools")
```

*  Install rBEFdata

```{r, eval = F}
library(devtools)
install_github("befdata/rbefdata", subdir = "rbefdata")
```

NOTE:

You should be aware that this gets you a bleeding edge version of rBEFdata. It
might fail to install or it can happen that certain functions are not working
as expected. If you prefer a stable and tested package you should use the
versions provided via CRAN.

### Usage

First load the package. It provides you with a set of options. You can querry
and set these with the `bef_options()` command. You should set the URL to the
server that you want to use. 

#### Setup

* Load the package

```{r, eval = F}
require(rbefdata)
```

* Show all options

```{r, eval = T}
bef_options()
```

* Set a URL

```{r, eval = T}
bef_options(url = "https://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de")
```

* Set your credentials 

NOTE: 

You can find these in your profile page on the BEFdata portal.

```{r, eval = T}
bef_options(user_credentials = "<yourcredentials>")
```

* You are ready

```{r, eval = T}
bef_options()
```

#### Get data

* Get single or multiple datasets at once

```{r, eval = F}
get_dataset(id = 16)
get_dataset(id = c(16, 17))
```

* Get attachments from datasets

```{r, eval = F}
get_dataset_attachment(id = 16)
get_dataset_attachment(id = c(16, 17))
```

* Get datasets from proposal

```{r, eval = F}
get_proposal_dataset(id = 122)
```

#### Update data 

* Update a datasets with local data

NOTE: 

This overwrites a dataset on the portal using a local dataset

```{r, eval = F}
update_dataset(id = 16)
```
